# Homework Rakamin Using SQL 1

## SQL Learning

In this week's module I learned about SQL Fundamentals. This module contains functions that are commonly used by data scientists, where this material is the basics of using SQL. Some of these functions include:

- `CREATE`: is a clause used to create a new table.
- `SELECT`: used to select any columns you want to retrieve from the table.
- `LIMIT`: used to limit the number of rows you want to take from the table.
- `WHERE`: used to limit/filter to certain specific columns only.
- `ORDER BY`: used to sort data from small to large (Ascending) by default or large to small (Descending) in certain columns after the data is retrieved.
- `INSERT`: is a clause for adding new data to a table.
- `UPDATE`: is a clause to change values in certain columns.
- `DELETE` : is a clause to delete data in a table.
